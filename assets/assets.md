game assets would be located here?
- textures
- audio
if this is game assets, audio should move to here correct? I would like to bundle audio into the .wasm if it makes sense (and generate audio on the fly in future)

?

how is this different from /web/public ?

currently the build step is copying the entire /assets dir into /dist root
