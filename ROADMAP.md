# Neon Geometry Tower Defense - Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step development plan for creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of our tower defense game.

## Phase 1: Core Engine and Rendering (Foundation)

1. **Game Loop and State Management**
   - Set up basic game loop with proper timing
   - Create game state structure
   - Implement state transitions (menu, playing, paused, game over)

2. **Rendering System**
   - Implement neon-style rendering for geometric shapes
   - Create a coordinate system and viewport
   - Add grid-based layout for tower placement
   - Implement basic UI elements (buttons, text)

3. **Input Handling**
   - Mouse click detection for tower placement and UI interaction
   - Implement tower selection mechanism
   - Add basic UI controls (start, pause, restart)

## Phase 2: Game Mechanics (Core Gameplay)

4. **Map and Path System**
   - Create a path system for enemies to follow
   - Implement waypoint-based movement
   - Add support for multiple map layouts

5. **Enemy System**
   - Implement basic enemy entity with health and movement
   - Create enemy waves and spawning mechanism
   - Add different enemy types (varying speed, health, size)
   - Implement enemy death and reward system

6. **Tower System**
   - Create base tower class with common properties
   - Implement different tower types:
     - Line Tower: Straight-line attacks
     - Triangle Tower: Area splash damage
     - Square Tower: Slowing effect
     - Pentagon Tower: High damage, slow rate of fire
   - Add tower targeting logic (first, last, strongest, weakest)
   - Implement tower placement rules and costs

7. **Projectile and Combat System**
   - Create projectile system with different behaviors
   - Implement collision detection
   - Add damage calculation and effects
   - Create visual feedback for attacks and hits

## Phase 3: Game Economy and Progression

8. **Resource System**
   - Implement currency for purchasing towers
   - Add resource gain from defeating enemies
   - Create resource UI display

9. **Wave System**
   - Create wave progression with increasing difficulty
   - Implement wave announcement and countdown
   - Add between-wave breaks for tower placement

10. **Player Life and Scoring**
    - Add player lives system
    - Implement scoring mechanism
    - Create game over condition and screen

## Phase 4: Polish and MVP Features

11. **Audio System**
    - Add basic sound effects for actions
    - Implement background music
    - Add volume controls

12. **Visual Effects**
    - Add particle effects for tower attacks
    - Implement death animations for enemies
    - Add visual feedback for tower placement and upgrades

13. **UI Improvements**
    - Create start screen and instructions
    - Add tower information panel
    - Implement wave and enemy information
    - Create score display and game over screen

14. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize rendering for large numbers of entities
    - Implement entity pooling for projectiles and effects
    - Add frame rate controls and optimization

15. **Testing and Balancing**
    - Balance tower costs, damage, and enemy health
    - Test different wave compositions
    - Adjust difficulty curve
    - Fix bugs and edge cases

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Tower upgrades and specialization paths
- Special abilities for towers
- Boss enemies with unique behaviors
- Multiple maps with different layouts
- Save/load functionality
- Achievements and challenges
- Mobile touch support
- Local high scores

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use Zig's comptime features for game entity types
- Leverage WebAssembly for performance-critical calculations
- Implement efficient memory management with arena allocators
- Use a component-based design for game entities
- Separate rendering logic from game state updates
