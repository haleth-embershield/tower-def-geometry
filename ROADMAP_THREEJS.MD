# Migration Roadmap: 2D Canvas to ThreeJS Isometric View

This roadmap outlines the steps for transitioning our tower defense game from a 2D Canvas implementation to a 3D isometric view using ThreeJS, while maintaining the Zig WebAssembly backend for game logic and physics.

## 1. Project Setup and ThreeJS Integration (Week 1)

- Create enemy movement animations (walking, flying, etc.)

### 5.3 Visual Effects
- Add particle effects for tower attacks
- Create impact visualization for hits
- Implement death/destruction animations for enemies
- Add visual feedback for game events (level completion, tower placement)

## 6. Performance Optimization (Week 6)

### 6.1 Rendering Optimization
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Set up instancing for similar geometries
- Optimize materials and textures
- Add level-of-detail (LOD) based on camera distance

- Implement dynamic lighting effects tied to gameplay
- Create visual themes for different levels

### 7.2 Audio Integration
- Update audio system to work with 3D spatial audio
- Position sound effects in 3D space
- Implement audio falloff based on camera distance

### 7.3 Accessibility and UX
- Ensure the game is still intuitive with 3D visualization
- Add camera controls tutorial
- Implement visual cues for gameplay elements
- Create UI elements that work well with the 3D perspective

## 8. Final Integration and Release (Week 8)

### 8.1 Final Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing on various devices
- Gameplay testing with the new visualization

### 8.2 Documentation
- Update code documentation to reflect the new architecture
- Create developer guides for extending the 3D functionality
- Document the Zig-ThreeJS interface for future development

### 8.3 Deployment
- Update build pipeline for optimized 3D assets
- Implement asset loading strategies (progressive, chunked)
- Release the updated template

## Implementation Notes

### Core Architectural Changes

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Zig (WASM): Game state, physics, core logic
   - ThreeJS: Visualization, rendering, effects
   - TypeScript: Bridging layer, UI, input handling

2. **Coordinate Systems**:
   - Game Logic: Continue using 2D grid coordinates internally
   - Rendering: Convert to 3D isometric space for visualization
   - Input: Convert 3D screen coordinates back to 2D game coordinates

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities
   - Implement instancing for similar objects (e.g., same tower types)
   - Keep physics calculations in Zig/WASM for performance
   - Optimize ThreeJS rendering with appropriate techniques (frustum culling, LOD)

### Maintaining Template Simplicity

While adding 3D visualization, we'll keep the template approachable by:

1. Creating clear separation between game logic and visualization
2. Providing simple, extensible base models that can be replaced
3. Documenting the architecture thoroughly
4. Including examples of extending the system with custom elements
5. Maintaining the same build and deployment simplicity

This roadmap provides a structured approach to migrating from 2D Canvas to ThreeJS while keeping the core strength of the Zig + TypeScript + WebAssembly architecture intact.
