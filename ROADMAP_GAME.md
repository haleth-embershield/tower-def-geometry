# Neon Geometry Tower Defense - Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step development plan for creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of our tower defense game.

## Phase 1: Core Engine and Rendering (Foundation) ✅

1. **Game Loop and State Management** ✅
   - Set up basic game loop with proper timing
   - Create game state structure
   - Implement state transitions (menu, playing, paused, game over)

2. **Rendering System** ✅
   - Implement neon-style rendering for geometric shapes
   - Create a coordinate system and viewport
   - Add grid-based layout for tower placement
   - Implement basic UI elements (buttons, text)

3. **Input Handling** ✅
   - Mouse click detection for tower placement and UI interaction
   - Implement tower selection mechanism
   - Add basic UI controls (start, pause, restart)

## Phase 2: Game Mechanics (Core Gameplay) ✅

4. **Map and Path System** ✅
   - Create a path system for enemies to follow
   - Implement waypoint-based movement
   - Add support for multiple map layouts

5. **Enemy System** ✅
   - Implement basic enemy entity with health and movement
   - Create enemy waves and spawning mechanism
   - Add different enemy types (varying speed, health, size)
   - Implement enemy death and reward system

6. **Tower System** ✅
   - Create base tower class with common properties
   - Implement different tower types:
     - Line Tower: Straight-line attacks
     - Triangle Tower: Area splash damage
     - Square Tower: Slowing effect
     - Pentagon Tower: High damage, slow rate of fire
   - Add tower targeting logic (first, last, strongest, weakest)
   - Implement tower placement rules and costs

7. **Projectile and Combat System** ✅
   - Create projectile system with different behaviors
   - Implement collision detection
   - Add damage calculation and effects
   - Create visual feedback for attacks and hits

## Phase 3: Game Economy and Progression ✅

8. **Resource System** ✅
   - Implement currency for purchasing towers
   - Add resource gain from defeating enemies
   - Create resource UI display

9. **Wave System** ✅
   - Create wave progression with increasing difficulty
   - Implement wave announcement and countdown
   - Add between-wave breaks for tower placement

10. **Player Life and Scoring** ✅
    - Add player lives system
    - Implement scoring mechanism
    - Create game over condition and screen

## Phase 4: Polish and MVP Features (In Progress)

11. **Audio System** ✅
    - Add basic sound effects for actions
    - Implement background music
    - Add volume controls

12. **Visual Effects** (Partially Complete)
    - Add particle effects for tower attacks ⏳
    - Implement death animations for enemies ⏳
    - Add visual feedback for tower placement and upgrades ✅

13. **UI Improvements** ✅
    - Create start screen and instructions
    - Add tower information panel
    - Implement wave and enemy information
    - Create score display and game over screen

14. **Performance Optimization** (Partially Complete)
    - Optimize rendering for large numbers of entities ⏳
    - Implement entity pooling for projectiles and effects ⏳
    - Add frame rate controls and optimization ⏳

15. **Testing and Balancing** (Ongoing)
    - Balance tower costs, damage, and enemy health ⏳
    - Test different wave compositions ⏳
    - Adjust difficulty curve ⏳
    - Fix bugs and edge cases ⏳

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- **Tower Upgrades System**
  - Allow towers to be upgraded for increased stats
  - Add visual changes to upgraded towers
  - Implement specialization paths for each tower type

- **Enhanced Enemy Variety**
  - Add boss enemies with unique behaviors
  - Implement enemies with special abilities (healing, shields, etc.)
  - Create flying enemies that follow different paths

- **Map Improvements**
  - Multiple maps with different layouts
  - Interactive map elements (teleporters, speed zones)
  - Day/night cycle affecting gameplay

- **Player Experience**
  - Save/load functionality
  - Achievements and challenges
  - Tutorial system for new players
  - Local high scores

- **Technical Improvements**
  - Mobile touch support
  - Improved audio system with spatial effects
  - Particle system for more dynamic visual effects
  - Optimizations for lower-end devices

## Completed Features
- Core game loop and rendering
- Tower placement and enemy path system
- Four unique tower types with different abilities
- Wave-based enemy progression
- Resource system for purchasing towers
- Audio effects for game events
- Basic UI with tower selection and game controls

## Current Focus
- Improving visual feedback and effects
- Balancing tower costs and enemy difficulty
- Optimizing performance for smoother gameplay
- Fixing bugs and edge cases

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use Zig's comptime features for game entity types
- Leverage WebAssembly for performance-critical calculations
- Implement efficient memory management with arena allocators
- Use a component-based design for game entities
- Separate rendering logic from game state updates
